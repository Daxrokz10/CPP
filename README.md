# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains my journey of learning C++ programming, focusing on data structures, algorithms, and core programming concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or implementation.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**
   - **Linked List**
     - `singly_linked_list.cpp`: Implementation of a singly linked list with basic operations like traversal and memory cleanup.
     - `doubly_Linkedlist.cpp`: Implementation of a doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal and insertion at the end.
     - `SingleLinkedListCRUD.cpp`: A class-based implementation of a singly linked list with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### 2. **Other Concepts**
   - Additional files will be added as I explore more topics in C++.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired file or folder.
3. Compile the C++ file using a compiler like `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file file_name.cpp
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file
   ```

## Topics Covered
- Basic C++ syntax and structure
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)

## Future Plans
- Add more data structures (e.g., stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- Implement algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming).
- Explore advanced C++ features like templates, STL, and multithreading.
